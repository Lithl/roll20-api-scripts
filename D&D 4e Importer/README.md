## D&D 4e Importer
Imports characters from the official 4e Character builder.

### Usage
Export a character from the "Load a character" screen of the Character Builder by selecting it and clicking the "Export" button. Alternatively, when viewing the character sheet, select "Character Summary" from the "Character Sheet Style" dropdown.

If you export the character, you will be prompted to select a location and filename to save a `*.dnd4e` file onto your computer. If you use the Character Summary, you can click the "Clicpboard" button to copy the text to your clipboard.

In order to get the import started, you need to paste it into a character's Bio text box. For the Character Summary, this is simple: simply click "Edit" on the character, select the Bio text area, then press `Ctrl+A` followed by `Ctrl+V`. The first step will select any text that is already there, and the second step will replace it with the text on your clipboard. Don't worry, the importer will restore you character's bio if he had one!

For the DND4E export file, this is slightly more complicated. You need to open the file with any plaintext editor like Notepad -- do not use a rich text editor like Microsoft Word! You will have to select all of the code there (`Ctrl+A`) and copy it (`Ctrl+C`). Then, follow the same import steps for the Character Summary, above.
